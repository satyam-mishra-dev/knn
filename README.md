# 🧠 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier

A simple implementation of the **K-Nearest Neighbors** algorithm for supervised learning in Python. This project demonstrates the use of KNN for classification tasks using both synthetic and real-world datasets.

## 📌 Overview

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a **non-parametric**, **instance-based** learning algorithm. It classifies a data point based on how its neighbors are classified.

Key features:

* Distance-based classification (Euclidean by default)
* Works for multi-class classification
* Easy to interpret and implement

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Load the dataset**
2. **Split** into training and test sets
3. For each test sample:

   * Calculate distance from all training samples
   * Sort by distance and pick the top `k` neighbors
   * Assign the most common class among neighbors

## 🛠️ Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/knn-project.git
cd knn-project
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶️ Usage

Run the KNN classifier on a dataset:

```bash
python main.py
```

Customize `k`, dataset path, and distance metric in `main.py`.
